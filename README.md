A browser extension that enables you to download complete course transcripts from Udemy lectures as markdown files, organized by chapters and packaged into a convenient ZIP archive.

## 🎯 Features

- **One-Click Download**: Start downloading all transcripts from a course with a single click
- **Chapter Organization**: Transcripts are automatically organized into folders by chapter
- **Pause & Resume**: Pause downloads mid-process and resume exactly where you left off
- **ZIP Export**: All transcripts are bundled into a single ZIP file for easy distribution
- **Merged Transcript**: Includes a full course transcript combining all lectures
- **Real-Time Progress**: Live progress tracking shows exactly which lecture is being processed
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing transcripts and API errors
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works on Chrome/Edge and Firefox
- **Lightweight & Efficient**: Random request delays prevent API rate limiting

## 📋 How It Works

1. Navigate to any Udemy course lecture page (requires you to be enrolled)
2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar to open the popup interface
3. Click **"Start Download"** to begin fetching transcripts
4. The extension:
   - Extracts the course structure from the page
   - Fetches captions from Udemy's API for each lecture
   - Converts VTT format captions to readable markdown
   - Organizes lectures by chapter
   - Generates a ZIP file with individual chapter folders plus a merged full transcript
5. The ZIP file automatically downloads to your default download folder

## 📦 Architecture

### Entry Points

#### Content Script (`content.ts`)
- Runs on Udemy course lecture pages (`*://www.udemy.com/course/*/learn/lecture/*`)
- Orchestrates the entire download workflow
- Implements pause/resume functionality through state management
- Recoverable: saves state after each lecture for crash resilience

**Workflow**:
1. Extract course ID and title from page DOM
2. Fetch complete course curriculum
3. Iterate through lectures and fetch transcripts
4. Save progress to persistent storage after each lecture
5. Generate ZIP file when complete
6. Support pause/resume mid-process

#### Popup Script (`main.ts`)
- Provides UI for user control (Start, Pause, Resume)
- Displays real-time progress, current task, and status badge
- Uses reactive storage watching for automatic UI updates
- Sends messages to content script to trigger actions

#### Popup UI (`index.html` + `style.css`)
- Clean, minimal interface matching Udemy's design language
- Progress bar with lecture counter
- Status badge (Idle, Running, Paused, Completed, Error)
- Current task description for transparency

**API Endpoints**:
- Curriculum: `https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/courses/{courseId}/subscriber-curriculum-items/`
- Transcripts: `https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/users/me/subscribed-courses/{courseId}/lectures/{lectureId}/`

### Endpoints Used

1. **Curriculum Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api-2.0/courses/{courseId}/subscriber-curriculum-items/
   ```
   Returns chapters, lectures, and quizzes with metadata

2. **Lecture Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api-2.0/users/me/subscribed-courses/{courseId}/lectures/{lectureId}/
   ```
   Returns asset details including caption URLs

### Error Handling
- Gracefully returns null for lectures without transcripts
- Continues processing even if individual lecture fails
- Logs errors for debugging without stopping the entire download

## 🔒 Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `storage` | Persist download state locally |
| `activeTab` | Detect active Udemy page |
| `host_permissions: https://www.udemy.com/*` | API access to Udemy services |

No data is sent to external servers except Udemy's official API.

## 💾 Auto Recover

Downloads are fully recoverable via persistent storage:

If the extension crashes or browser closes mid-download, users can click **Resume** to continue from the last completed lecture.

## 📝 File Output Format

### ZIP Structure
```
CourseTitle_Transcripts.zip
├── 01_Chapter1/

│   └── ...
├── 02_Chapter2/
│   ├── 01_Lecture1.md
│   └── ...

### Markdown Format
- Clean, plain text with light markdown formatting
- Timestamps and metadata removed for readability
- Properly formatted for note-taking and searching
- Compatible with all markdown viewers and note-taking apps


## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Enrollment Required**: Only works for courses you're enrolled in
- **English Transcripts Only**: Currently extracts English captions only
- **Video Lectures Only**: Skips non-video content (quizzes, documents)
- **API Dependent**: Requires Udemy API availability (can be shutdown by Udemy at any time)
- **Rate Limiting**: Random delays to prevent API throttling may increase download time
